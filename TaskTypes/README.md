<details closed> <summary>Recog RKG (2026-01-06)</summary>

### Recog RKG (2026-01-06)
Uses `recog` -> `instructRKG` -> `RKG`. 
* (The version of `recog` I have here is different from the actual deployed version)
* The goal is to skip `RKG` trials when the user says 'Yes' if they saw the word on a previous list or not.
* So we go from `recog` -> instruct
